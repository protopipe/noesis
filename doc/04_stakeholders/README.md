# Stakeholders

Stakeholders represent **responsibility holders and decision perspectives**.

They are not users.
They are not personas.
They are not teams or organizational units.

A stakeholder defines:
- what kind of outcome matters
- which trade-offs are acceptable
- which risks are owned

Stakeholders may:
- conflict with each other
- pursue incompatible desired outcomes
- exist simultaneously within a single person

Stakeholders are defined to:
- make desired outcomes explicit
- expose tensions early
- prevent implicit prioritization

Stakeholders do not define solutions.
They define perspective.
