# Contrasts

Contrasts sharpen understanding by comparison.

They describe:
- what Protopipe is not
- which approaches are deliberately avoided
- how similar concepts differ in intent or effect

Contrasts are explanatory, not normative.

They do not:
- introduce new mechanics
- define preferred solutions
- invalidate other approaches

Contrasts exist to reduce ambiguity,
not to win arguments.
