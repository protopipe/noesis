# Stakeholder: CTO

## Definition
Represents the responsibility perspective for system behavior, architectural integrity, and technical risk.

## Core Responsibility
Ensuring systems evolve safely under change while remaining explainable to non-technical decision-makers.

## Owned Risks
- Hidden architectural coupling
- Accumulating technical debt with delayed impact
- Uncontrolled complexity growth
- Responsibility without architectural authority

## Desired Outcomes
- Architecture supports safe change
- Technical risks surface early
- Ownership and boundaries are explicit
- System behavior is explainable in business terms

## Trade-off Authority
- Short-term delivery vs. structural integrity
- Standardization vs. local optimization
- Innovation vs. operational stability

## Non-Goals
- Product prioritization
- Financial provisioning
- People performance management

## Relationship to Roles
- CTO role
- Architecture steward role
- Executive translator role

## Notes on Conflict
Frequent tension with CPO (speed vs. safety) and CEO (cost vs. resilience).
