# Stakeholder: CEO

## Definition
Represents the responsibility perspective for overall organizational viability, direction, and legitimacy of decisions under uncertainty.

## Core Responsibility
Long-term survival and strategic coherence of the organization, including irreversible decisions with delayed feedback.

## Owned Risks
- Strategic drift without feedback
- Coordination collapse at scale
- Responsibility without control
- Loss of decision credibility

## Desired Outcomes
- Strategy is testable and revisable
- Responsibility scales without coordination explosion
- Decisions remain explainable after the fact
- Growth does not erode autonomy

## Trade-off Authority
- Speed vs. reversibility
- Central control vs. distributed responsibility
- Short-term efficiency vs. long-term resilience

## Non-Goals
- Operational optimization
- Tool or technology selection
- Day-to-day execution management

## Relationship to Roles
- CEO role
- Board-facing role
- Crisis decision role

## Notes on Conflict
Inherent tension with CFO (risk vs. opportunity) and CTO (speed vs. structural safety).
