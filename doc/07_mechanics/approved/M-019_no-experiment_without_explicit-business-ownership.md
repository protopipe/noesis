# Mechanic: No Experiment without Explicit Business Ownership

## Intent

Ensure that experiments are driven by insight and responsibility,
not by technical convenience or delivery pressure.

Experiments must be owned by those
who are accountable for understanding user needs
and interpreting learning outcomes.

---

## Problems Addressed

- Responsibility Without Control
- Feature Output over Outcome
- Experiments Without Learning
- Fear of Transparency

---

## Desired Outcomes Supported

- Stakeholders validate assumptions instead of delegating risk
- Product Owners and Product Managers own learning outcomes
- Teams focus on execution, not hypothesis justification
- Reverse feedback loops remain intact

---

## Enforced Behavior

This mechanic enforces that:

- every experiment has an explicitly assigned business owner
- the owner is accountable for:
  - the experiment hypothesis
  - interpretation of results
  - downstream decisions based on learning
- experiments without ownership are invalid
  and must not be executed

Ownership may be held by:
- domain stakeholders
- product owners
- product managers

Ownership must be explicit and visible.

---

## Structural Constraints

This mechanic introduces the following constraints:

- experiments cannot be delegated without responsibility
- technical teams are not forced to defend hypotheses
- interpretation authority is bound to domain insight
- “nobody decided” becomes structurally impossible

These constraints intentionally trade
execution convenience
for epistemic responsibility.

---

## Mechanic Boundary

This mechanic:
- governs eligibility for experiment execution
- enforces accountability for learning outcomes

This mechanic does **not**:
- prescribe organizational roles or titles
- evaluate experiment quality
- mandate experimentation methods
- assign implementation responsibility

---

## Failure Modes

This mechanic typically fails when:

- ownership exists only nominally
- experiments are initiated without decision authority
- results are delivered without interpretation
- responsibility shifts after results are known
- experiments are run “for the data”

Failure is observable
when learning exists
but no decision follows.
