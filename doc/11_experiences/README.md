# Experiences

Experiences describe how Protopipe is encountered and perceived.

They may include:
- narrative examples
- role-based perspectives
- experiential walkthroughs

Experiences are illustrative.

They do not:
- define rules
- constrain decisions
- introduce canonical facts

Experiences support understanding.
They are not part of the reasoning core.
