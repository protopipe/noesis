# Strategic Operating Model

Protopipe is not a framework.  
It is a **decision and learning system by design**.

The operational loop is explicitly structured and end-to-end:

1. **Identify the problem**  
   (Golden Circle, WHY)

2. **Formulate a hypothesis**  
   (ProtoPortfolio)

3. **Define the feature**  
   (BDD / Cucumber, Feature Steps)

4. **Run the experiment**  
   (Review Environments, A/B Testing)

5. **Measure and evaluate KPIs**  
   (Lean Dashboard)

6. **Derive insights**  
   (Hypothesis validated or falsified)

7. **Adjust strategy**  
   (ProtoPortfolio update)

8. **Reprioritize and decide rollout**  
   (Rollout decision, KPI Tree)

This loop replaces:

- roadmaps → with hypotheses  
- status reporting → with impact data  
- opinion-based steering → with real-time feedback  

The system institutionalizes:

- **learning instead of control**  
- **responsibility instead of supervision**  
- **progress through visibility**

> Anything that is not connected back through feedback  
> is not considered part of Protopipe.
