# Golden Circle

## WHY

We hate wasted time caused by missing feedback.

Every decision made without real data costs teams days — and companies millions.

Organizations do not fail because of a lack of competence, but because of:
- decisions without measurable feedback
- invisible dependencies
- discussions that produce opinions instead of responsibility

**Protopipe exists to radically shorten feedback loops, make them visible, and make them enforceable** — across roles, teams, and organizational levels.

---

## HOW

We create an integrated thinking, decision, and feedback system that:

- makes problems explicit before solutions are built
- connects hypotheses to real measurements
- distributes responsibility through visibility, not through process
- connects architecture, quality, and product thinking

Core principles:
- A single shared loop: *Problem → Hypothesis → Implementation → Measurement → Insight*
- Production as a validation space, not a target state
- Quality as an emergent property of good architecture, not a gate
- Tensions (e.g. speed ↔ responsibility) are made visible, not resolved away

---

## WHAT

Protopipe is a platform that makes this loop operationally tangible through:

- a **ProtoPortfolio** that connects hypotheses, experiments, and decisions
- a **KPI Tree** that makes impact visible instead of activity
- **review and experimentation mechanisms** that enforce early feedback
- a **dashboard / cockpit** that shows responsibility, dependencies, and progress

The concrete *What* is **intentionally not fully specified**:
- multiple competing hypotheses are allowed
- implementations are changeable
- production readiness emerges through explicit rollout decisions

> Ambiguity is allowed in the *What* — never in the *Why*.
