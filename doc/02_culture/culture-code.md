# Culture Code

The Protopipe Culture Code defines **how we think, decide, and work**.  
It is not a rulebook, but a **cultural framework** that provides orientation without removing autonomy.

The strategic purpose of Protopipe is defined in the **Golden Circle**  
(see `01_why/golden-circle.md`).  
This document describes **how that purpose is lived in everyday practice**.

## Our Understanding of Culture

At Protopipe, culture is neither a values poster nor an onboarding artifact.  
Culture is **what happens when nobody is watching**.

Our culture becomes visible when:
- decisions are made under uncertainty
- trade-offs surface
- responsibility is distributed
- failures occur

---

## Cultural Guardrails

These guardrails are **non-negotiable**.  
They apply regardless of role, seniority, or context.

- **Experiential progress over technical completion**  
  Visible feedback matters more than perfect execution.

- **Only what we measure can be optimized**  
  Learning without measurement is opinion.

- **Visibility creates responsibility**  
  What is visible can be discussed, improved, or discarded.

- **Culture is lived, not enforced**  
  Principles are fixed stars, not checklists.

- **Eat your own dogfood**  
  We apply our own methods, tools, and thinking to ourselves before offering them to others.

## Decision Logic

Protopipe favors decisions that are:

- made early  
- reversible  
- driven by feedback rather than authority  

The following principles apply:

- **Accountability follows causality (Causer Principle)**  
  Whoever creates a problem must be able to detect and resolve it.

- **Avoid the Duty-of-Care Anti-Pattern**  
  Systems are designed so responsibility sits where impact occurs.

- **Exploration before specification**  
  Assumptions are validated before solutions are industrialized.

- **Testability is productivity**  
  Good testability reduces coordination overhead and root-cause analysis.

---

## Risk-First Exploration

**At Protopipe, we choose courage over comfort.**  
We deliberately start where uncertainty and impact are highest, instead of postponing risk.

By identifying the path with the greatest risks across the entire implementation,  
we explore those risks **before large-scale investment begins**.

This allows us to build solutions that are **solid, resilient, and grounded in reality — not optimism**.

---

## Language & Communication

Language is a core cultural instrument at Protopipe.

- We prefer **shared terminology** over individual interpretation.
- Documentation is **communication**, not an end in itself.
- Good documentation has a **narrative thread**, not a forced format.

Communication is:
- asynchronous by default
- synchronous by preparation
- respectful, clear, and solution-oriented

---

## Responsibility in Everyday Work

At Protopipe, the following heuristics apply:

- If nobody is responsible for it, it will not happen.  
- If nobody understands it, it is not architecture.  
- If nobody can test it, it is not a feature.  
- If nobody needs it, it is not a problem.  

These statements are **not rules**, but **cultural litmus tests**.

---

## Scope & Boundaries

This Culture Code is intentionally **context-independent**.

It is:
- not a customer promise  
- not marketing material  
- not a process handbook  

It is the **cultural reference frame** from which:
- architectural principles  
- decision rules  
- narratives  
- technological preferences  

are derived.

> If a decision contradicts this Culture Code,  
> it is not a Protopipe decision.
