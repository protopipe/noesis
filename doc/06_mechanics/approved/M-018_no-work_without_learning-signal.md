# Mechanic: No Work Evaluation without Learning Signal

## Intent

Eliminate fear-driven behavior
by shifting the basis of evaluation
from requirement fulfillment
to validated learning.

Work must be evaluated by what was learned,
not by whether it was “right” or “wrong”.

---

## Problems Addressed

- Fear of Transparency
- Feature Output over Outcome
- Strategy as Intent, Not Hypothesis
- Analysis as a Side Effect

---

## Use-Cases Enabled

- Teams surface uncertainty without penalty
- Leadership evaluates progress without blame
- Learning replaces justification
- Transparency becomes low-risk by design

---

## Enforced Behavior

This mechanic enforces that:

- work may only be evaluated
  if it produces an explicit learning signal
- absence of learning invalidates evaluation
- requirement fulfillment alone
  is insufficient for positive or negative judgment
- outcomes are interpreted as knowledge gained,
  not correctness achieved

If no learning signal exists,
evaluation is structurally meaningless.

---

## Structural Constraints

This mechanic introduces the following constraints:

- “success” and “failure” lose evaluative meaning
- effort without learning is indistinguishable from noise
- justification and defense are replaced by evidence
- transparency no longer increases personal risk

These constraints intentionally trade
binary judgment
for continuous learning and adaptation.

---

## Mechanic Boundary

This mechanic:
- governs eligibility for work evaluation
- enforces learning as the primary success signal

This mechanic does **not**:
- define what constitutes valuable learning
- mandate experimentation techniques
- prescribe feedback rituals
- enforce psychological behavior

---

## Failure Modes

This mechanic typically fails when:

- learning is asserted but not evidenced
- metrics are used to judge individuals
- outcomes are labeled as success or failure
  instead of insight
- transparency is used for comparison or blame
- learning signals exist but are ignored

Failure is observable
when teams optimize for appearance
instead of understanding.
