# Mechanic Candidates

This directory contains **non-canonical mechanic hypotheses**.

Candidates propose potential enforced constraints
but are **not yet accepted as mechanics**.

They are expected to be:
- incomplete
- debatable
- temporary

If a candidate stabilizes,
it must be promoted to an approved mechanic
or removed.
