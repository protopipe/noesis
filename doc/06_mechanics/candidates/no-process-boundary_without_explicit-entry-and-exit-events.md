# Candidate: No Process Boundary without Explicit Entry and Exit Events

## Hypothesis

Implicit boundaries destroy testability and observability
and delay feedback.

---

## Intended Constraint

Every transition between process steps
must be defined by explicit:

- entry events
- exit events

---

## Problem Signal

- process verification becomes manual and late
- failures are invisible between steps
- quality gates cannot be automated

---

## Open Questions

- how granular must entry/exit events be?
- how are variants and outcomes represented?
