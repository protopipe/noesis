# Capabilities

Capabilities describe **what the Protopipe platform must be able to enable**
in order to address acknowledged problems
and support desired outcomes.

Capabilities are:
- solution-neutral
- implementation-agnostic
- stable over time

Capabilities are not:
- features
- services
- components
- architectural building blocks

A capability acts as an **entry point into complexity**.

When a capability is explored:
- internal complexity becomes visible
- capability-local invariants may emerge
- abstraction and isolation patterns may be applied
- structural cuts may be derived

Capabilities themselves do not contain decisions.
They provide a scope for analysis.
