# Principles

These principles describe **how Protopipe consistently makes decisions** across product, architecture, technology, and collaboration.

They are not rules and not best practices.  
They are **decision lenses**: when trade-offs arise, these principles guide direction.

---

## 1. Feedback over Opinion

Decisions are validated through feedback, not authority or consensus.

- Opinions are allowed.
- Unmeasured opinions do not have veto power.
- Feedback loops are preferred over debates.

---

## 2. Visibility before Control

We do not optimize for control mechanisms.  
We optimize for visibility.

- What is visible can be discussed.
- What can be discussed can be improved.
- What remains invisible accumulates risk.

---

## 3. Responsibility follows Causality

Responsibility sits where impact is created.

- Teams must be able to observe the consequences of their actions.
- Systems are designed so cause and effect remain traceable.
- Delegating responsibility without control is an anti-pattern.

---

## 4. Exploration before Industrialization

We validate assumptions before scaling solutions.

- Early exploration reduces late-stage failure.
- Uncertainty is addressed deliberately, not postponed.
- Industrialization without validation increases systemic risk.

---

## 5. Risk-First over Comfort-First

We start with the highest-impact uncertainties.

- Risk discovery is prioritized over early certainty.
- The critical path is evaluated by uncertainty × impact.
- Large-scale investment follows validated risk, not hope.

---

## 6. Testability enables Speed

Speed emerges from testability, not shortcuts.

- Testable systems reduce coordination overhead.
- Debuggable systems reduce recovery time.
- Untestable systems slow organizations down.

---

## 7. Modularity reduces Blast Radius

We prefer systems that fail locally.

- Clear boundaries reduce unintended side effects.
- Smaller units are easier to reason about.
- Isolation enables parallel progress.

---

## 8. Shared Language beats Local Optimization

We optimize for shared understanding over individual efficiency.

- Common terminology reduces friction.
- Documentation aligns thinking, not compliance.
- Language shapes architecture and behavior.

---

## 9. Decisions must be Reversible by Design

Whenever possible, decisions should allow revision.

- Reversible decisions encourage learning.
- Irreversible decisions require higher validation effort.
- Feedback determines permanence, not planning.

---

## 10. Tools serve Culture, not Vice Versa

Tools amplify culture; they do not replace it.

- Tools are chosen for cultural alignment.
- Process follows thinking, not tooling.
- A bad tool can undermine good intentions.

---

## Closing Note

These principles are meant to be **used**, not admired.

When principles conflict, trade-offs must be made **explicit**.  
Silence is a decision — and usually the worst one.

> If a solution violates multiple principles,  
> it is likely solving the wrong problem.
