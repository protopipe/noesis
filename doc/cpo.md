# Stakeholder: CPO

## Definition
Represents the responsibility perspective for product direction, learning, and outcome validation.

## Core Responsibility
Ensuring that product decisions lead to validated outcomes rather than untested output.

## Owned Risks
- Shipping the wrong thing efficiently
- Learning arriving too late
- Roadmaps turning assumptions into commitments
- Opportunity cost through delayed insight

## Desired Outcomes
- Product decisions are explicit hypotheses
- Learning velocity exceeds delivery velocity
- Outcomes are measurable and attributable
- Optionality is preserved over time

## Trade-off Authority
- Delivery speed vs. learning depth
- Commitment vs. optionality
- Focus vs. exploration

## Non-Goals
- Technical implementation
- Team capacity management
- Organizational process design

## Relationship to Roles
- CPO role
- Product strategy role
- Discovery framing role

## Notes on Conflict
Natural tension with CFO (cost of learning) and CTO (feasibility constraints).
