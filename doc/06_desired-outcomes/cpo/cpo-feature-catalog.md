# CPO: Product Feature Catalog Built In

## Problems Addressed

- When Analysis Is a Side Effect
- Opaque Decision Logic
- Learning Is Optional
- Coordination Over Clarity

## Situation

Product knowledge is scattered across documents, tickets, and meeting memory.
Specifications drift, and “what the product does” becomes implicit, disputed, or outdated.
Analysis and shared understanding emerge incidentally, not as an owned, durable artifact.

## What Changes

Product behavior is captured in a durable, shared form that remains verifiable over time.
The feature catalog functions as living product knowledge instead of a wiki that decays.
Teams can align on behavior without recurring rediscovery.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must be able to maintain a shared, testable representation of product behavior that survives organizational churn and reduces reliance on meetings for alignment.

## Result

The CPO operates with a reliable, current product knowledge base.
Alignment becomes cheaper and faster because behavior stays explicit and stable.
