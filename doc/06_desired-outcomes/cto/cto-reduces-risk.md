# CTO: Reduces Risk Early

## Problems Addressed

- Yak Shaving Over the Critical Path
- Decisions Without Feedback
- High Coupling, Low Fault Locality
- Untestable Architecture

## Situation

Risk hides behind apparent progress.
Everything works — until it doesn’t — and then failures cascade across a tightly coupled landscape.
The organization tends to start where uncertainty is low, delaying validation of critical-path risks.

## What Changes

Risk is surfaced early and treated as something to validate before scaling.
Work starts with critical-path uncertainties rather than peripheral “safe” tasks.
The CTO can shape organizational risk profile proactively instead of reacting to incidents.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must be able to identify critical paths and validate high-uncertainty, high-impact risks early through fast feedback loops.

## Result

The CTO moves from incident-driven reaction to risk-profile steering.
Failures become more attributable, and costly late discovery is reduced.
