# CFO: Eliminates Shadow-IT Reporting

## Problems Addressed

- Reporting Over Reasoning
- Metrics Without Causality
- Opaque Decision Logic
- Political Trust Over Competence

## Situation

Finance reporting often requires a parallel data pipeline (“shadow IT”) to produce decision-relevant numbers.
This duplicates effort, creates competing sources of truth, and increases political negotiation about which numbers “count.”
Experts spend time defending data instead of improving decisions.

## What Changes

Decision-relevant metrics and their causal interpretation become shared, reliable, and directly connected to product decisions.
Reporting shifts from producing numbers to using trustworthy signals for steering.
The need for parallel CFO-owned reporting infrastructure disappears.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must maintain a single, decision-oriented metrics model with explicit causality and shared trust across roles.

## Result

The CFO no longer needs shadow systems to create credibility.
Decision-making accelerates because the organization shares one trusted reality.
