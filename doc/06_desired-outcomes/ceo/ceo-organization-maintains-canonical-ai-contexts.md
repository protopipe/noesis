# Organization Maintains Canonical AI Contexts

## Problems Addressed

- Implicit Knowledge and Fragmented AI Contexts
- Decisions Without Feedback
- Opaque Decision Logic

---

## Situation

The organization uses multiple AI tools and models
across teams and roles.

Without a shared knowledge base and vocabulary,
AI outputs vary, conflict, and cannot be verified.

AI accelerates local work,
but undermines shared understanding.

---

## What Changes

The organization establishes:

- a canonical, versioned knowledge base
- explicit context boundaries for AI usage
- shared language and definitions
- reproducible AI interactions

AI becomes a participant in the system —
not an uncontrolled actor.

---

## Enabled Capability

The organization can:

- provide consistent context to different AI systems
- validate AI outputs against canonical knowledge
- evolve AI usage without vendor lock-in
- scale AI support without losing coherence

---

## Result

AI supports learning and decision-making
without fragmenting organizational knowledge.

AI becomes interchangeable.
Knowledge remains stable.
