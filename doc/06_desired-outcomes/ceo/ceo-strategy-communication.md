# CEO: Strategy Communication and Reporting

## Problems Addressed

- Decisions Without Feedback
- Opaque Decision Logic
- Strategy as Intent, Not as Hypothesis
- Reporting Over Reasoning

## Situation

Strategy dissolves between intent and execution.
Decisions are communicated as status and direction, but the assumptions and measurable expectations behind them remain implicit.
Leadership visibility depends on slide decks and recurring reporting cycles rather than on observable causal signals.

## What Changes

Strategy is represented as explicit hypotheses with measurable outcomes.
The CEO can see what changed because decisions were made and validated, not because a report was assembled.
Decision rationale and outcomes remain traceable across execution.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must be able to represent strategy as testable hypotheses and continuously connect decisions to measurable signals.

## Result

The CEO steers through evidence and learning, not through status narratives.
Strategic communication becomes durable and decision-oriented, reducing ambiguity and re-debate.
