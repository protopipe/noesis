# Desired Outcomes

Desired outcomes describe **what must become true**
from the perspective of a specific stakeholder.

They act as **strategic fix stars**:
- they provide long-term orientation
- they may be temporarily unreachable
- they may conflict with other desired outcomes

Desired outcomes:
- are explicitly bound to stakeholders
- are not required to be compatible
- may introduce trade-offs by design

Desired outcomes are not:
- features
- implementations
- roadmaps
- guarantees

Desired outcomes legitimize mechanics.
They do not prescribe how outcomes are achieved.
