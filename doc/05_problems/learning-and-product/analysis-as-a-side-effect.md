# When Analysis Is a Side Effect

## The Problem

Many organizations assume that analysis naturally emerges
from planning and coordination activities.

Scrum and SAFe implicitly rely on the idea
that someone has the overall picture.

In reality, analysis happens incidentally —
as a by-product of meetings, discussions, and slide decks.

---

## Why This Happens

- Analysis is embedded in rituals, not owned explicitly
- No clear responsibility for maintaining the overall picture
- Planning events are expected to create alignment automatically
- Documentation is treated as secondary to execution
- Orchestration substitutes structural clarity

As coordination increases, analysis becomes more fragmented.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Analysis is scattered across tools and presentations
- Decisions depend on who was present in which meeting
- Context is lost between planning cycles
- The same questions are re-discussed repeatedly
- Increased coordination effort does not improve clarity

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When analysis is incidental:

- teams spend time aligning instead of learning
- decisions are delayed by missing context
- delivery depends on synchronization rather than autonomy
- learning remains implicit and non-transferable

Speed degrades as coordination overhead grows.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

Analysis cannot emerge reliably from meetings.

The problem is rooted in:
- process-driven planning models
- unclear ownership of understanding
- lack of structural visibility across decisions

Without a system that makes assumptions,
measurements, and learnings explicit,
analysis remains a side effect — never an outcome.
