# Problems

Problems describe **acknowledged systemic tensions**.

A problem captures:
- what is repeatedly failing or degrading
- where feedback is missing, delayed, or distorted
- which situations cause recurring friction or risk

Problems are:
- observable
- describable without proposing solutions
- stable enough to reason about

Problems are not:
- feature requests
- backlog items
- improvement ideas
- customer wishes

Problems exist independently of capabilities or mechanics.
They justify why change is necessary,
not how change should happen.
