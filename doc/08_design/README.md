# Design Language (CI/CD)

This chapter defines Protopipe’s visual and verbal design constraints:
- Corporate Identity / Corporate Design (CI/CD)
- Visual grammar (especially Swimlanes)
- UI principles for prototypes and product surfaces

Rule: Design here is canonical. Derivatives (slides, website, mockups) must reference this.
