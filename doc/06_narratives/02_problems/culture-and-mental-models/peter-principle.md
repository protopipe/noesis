# The Peter Principle

## The Problem

In hierarchical organizations, people are often promoted
based on success in their current role,
not on suitability for the next one.

As a result, individuals are promoted
until they reach a position where they are no longer effective.

Competence in one context is mistaken for competence in another.

---

## Why This Happens

- Promotion is used as the primary reward mechanism
- Technical excellence is conflated with leadership capability
- Alternative career paths are missing or undervalued
- Hierarchies assume upward movement as progress
- Evaluating future competence is harder than rewarding past success

Organizations optimize for promotion velocity,
not for role fit.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Strong contributors struggle in leadership roles
- Managers avoid technical or complex decisions
- Decision quality declines with seniority
- Responsibility increases while understanding decreases
- Problems are escalated instead of resolved

People stop solving problems
and start managing around them.

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When the Peter Principle dominates:

- complex problems are deferred or fragmented
- decisions are made without deep understanding
- learning is replaced by process and delegation
- delivery slows as uncertainty moves upward

The organization becomes dependent
on coordination instead of competence.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

The Peter Principle is not an individual failure.

It is reinforced by:
- promotion-centric career models
- lack of expert or dual career paths
- status systems tied to hierarchy
- cultures that equate seniority with authority

As long as advancement means moving away from problem-solving,
organizations systematically reduce
their capacity to handle complexity.
