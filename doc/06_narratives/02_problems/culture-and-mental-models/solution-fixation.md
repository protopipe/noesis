# Solution Fixation

## The Problem

Organizations often commit to solutions
before they have fully understood the underlying problem.

Discussions quickly shift toward implementation details,
while the problem itself remains vague, implicit, or contested.

Solutions become the center of attention.
Problems fade into the background.

---

## Why This Happens

- Solutions create a sense of progress and control
- Problems are ambiguous and uncomfortable
- Early agreement feels like alignment
- Questioning solutions is perceived as resistance
- Certainty is culturally rewarded more than inquiry

Problem exploration is seen as delay,
not as necessary work.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Long debates about how to build something
- Little agreement on why it should be built
- Multiple solutions addressing different interpretations of the problem
- High effort spent refining the wrong thing
- Reluctance to abandon solutions once work has started

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When solutions precede problem clarity:

- incorrect assumptions scale quickly
- learning is postponed until after delivery
- delivery optimizes activity, not impact
- teams move fast in the wrong direction

Speed increases,
but effectiveness does not.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

Solution fixation is not an individual failure.

It is reinforced by:
- planning and budgeting processes
- incentive systems focused on delivery
- cultural expectations around certainty
- governance models that reward commitment over learning

Without structural emphasis on problem understanding,
organizations repeatedly solve the wrong problems efficiently.
