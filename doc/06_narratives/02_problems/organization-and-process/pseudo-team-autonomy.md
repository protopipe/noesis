# Pseudo Team Autonomy

## The Problem

Teams are often described as autonomous,
but in practice depend on many external decisions,
shared resources, and cross-team coordination.

Autonomy exists in name,
but not in effect.

Teams are responsible for outcomes
they cannot fully influence.

---

## Why This Happens

- Teams share data, infrastructure, or deployment paths
- Architectural dependencies cross team boundaries
- Decision authority remains centralized
- Autonomy is declared without structural decoupling
- Organizational design outpaces system design

Teams are asked to act independently
in systems that are not designed for independence.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Teams wait for other teams to proceed
- Releases require cross-team approval
- Local optimizations cause global side effects
- Teams escalate issues they cannot resolve
- Autonomy initiatives fail to scale

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When autonomy is only symbolic:

- delivery speed is limited by external dependencies
- teams become defensive and risk-averse
- learning is constrained by factors outside team control
- ownership loses meaning

Speed depends on coordination,
not capability.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

Team autonomy cannot be created by mandate.

It depends on:
- architectural decoupling
- clear ownership of systems and outcomes
- aligned decision boundaries
- transparent constraints

Without these structural foundations,
autonomy remains a label,
and organizations trade empowerment rhetoric
for operational friction.
