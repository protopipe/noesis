# When Analysis Is a Side Effect

Scrum and SAFe implicitly assume that someone has the overview.

Analysis happens in:
- refinement
- PI planning
- coordination meetings
- slide decks

But it is unclear:
- who owns the analysis
- where it lives
- how it evolves

When PI planning is insufficient, coordination increases.

Analysis becomes a by-product of meetings.

Protopipe follows a different logic.

Analysis is not a prerequisite.
Analysis is not a side effect.
**Analysis is the outcome.**

Every loop produces:
- explicit assumptions
- explicit measurements
- explicit learnings

The overview emerges from visibility,
not from orchestration.
