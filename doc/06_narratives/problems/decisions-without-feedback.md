# Decisions Without Feedback

Most organizations do not lack expertise.
They lack feedback.

Decisions are made based on confidence, consensus, or hierarchy.
Reality responds weeks or months later.

By then, learning is expensive and responsibility is diffuse.

Protopipe assumes:
A decision without feedback is a liability.

The goal is not certainty,
but to shorten the distance between decision and consequence.
