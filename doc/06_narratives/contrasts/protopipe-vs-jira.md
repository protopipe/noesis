# Protopipe vs. Jira

Jira organizes work.
Protopipe organizes decisions.

Jira answers:
- Who is working on what?
- What is the status?

Protopipe answers:
- Why are we doing this?
- What do we expect to learn?
- What changed because of it?

With Protopipe:
- experiments replace estimation debates
- time tracking becomes irrelevant
- throughput is measured via feature coverage

Discussions about story points or person-days disappear.
Flow emerges from visibility, not estimation.

Jira optimizes throughput.
Protopipe optimizes **learning and responsibility**.

They are not competitors.
They operate on different layers.
