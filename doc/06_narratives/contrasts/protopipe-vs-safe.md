# Protopipe vs. SAFe

SAFe optimizes alignment through synchronization.
Synchronization is expensive.

Typical costs:
- 1–2 days of full-IT planning
- delayed feedback (2–3 month PI cycles)

SAFe assumes coordination creates understanding.
It cannot guarantee protection from Conway’s Law. Missaligned Architecture destroyes every purpose of SAFe.

Protopipe:
- feedback cycles of 1–2 sprints
- explicit context boundaries
- full team autonomy
- visible progress without central orchestration

No project manager is required.
Responsibility is built into the system.
