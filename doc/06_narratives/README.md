# Narratives

Narratives translate Protopipe’s canonical thinking into **human-readable stories**.

They are not marketing material.
They are not feature descriptions.
They are not sales scripts.

Narratives exist to:
- make abstract principles tangible
- support decision-making conversations
- prevent misinterpretation of Protopipe as “just another tool”

They answer the question:
> *What actually changes when Protopipe is present?*

Narratives are written from **real roles, real tensions, and real decisions**.
