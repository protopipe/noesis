# Narratives

Narratives translate Protopipe’s canonical thinking into **human-readable stories**.

They are not marketing material.  
They are not feature descriptions.  
They are not sales scripts.

Narratives exist to:
- make abstract principles tangible
- support decision-making conversations
- prevent misinterpretation of Protopipe as “just another tool”

They answer the question:

> *What actually changes when Protopipe is present?*

Narratives are written from **real roles, real tensions, and real decisions** —
not from tools, frameworks, or implementations.

## How to read this section (Narrative Layering)

Protopipe narratives follow a deliberate layering model.

We do not describe solutions as feature sets.
Instead, we move from **stable problem understanding**
to **observable outcomes**
and finally to the **organizational capabilities required** to sustain them.

**Narrative sequence:**

1. **Problems**  
   Systemic blockers that prevent fast delivery, learning, and responsibility.

2. **Use-Cases**  
   Observable changes in everyday work for specific roles and contexts
   once those problems are addressed.

3. **Capabilities (APDP)**  
   The organizational abilities required to reliably produce these outcomes —
   independent of specific tools or implementations.

This is where the narrative ends.

Capabilities describe **what an organization must be able to do**,
not **how it is technically realized**.

---

## What Narratives intentionally exclude

Narratives do **not** describe:
- technical architectures
- mechanisms or patterns
- tools, platforms, or implementations

These belong to architecture and technology sections
and are intentionally separated to avoid feature-driven thinking.

This separation keeps Protopipe anchored in:

> **Love the problem, not the solution.**
