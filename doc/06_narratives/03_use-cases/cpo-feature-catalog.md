# CPO: Product Feature Catalog Built In

Protopipe treats features as executable knowledge.

Using Cucumber:
- features are described in domain language
- documentation and verification converge
- behavior stays correct because it is tested

The feature catalog is not a wiki.
It is a living, verified specification.
