# Sales Language Principles

We talk about:
- augmented strategy
- feedback cycles
- time to market through learning
- visibility as a management tool
- KPIs built into the system
- rationalization through clarity
- documentation as a living asset

We avoid:
- feature lists
- certainty promises
- velocity theater

Protopipe is not sold as control.
It is sold as **better decisions, earlier**.
