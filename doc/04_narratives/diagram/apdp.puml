' Layers: from problem space to concrete implementations
rectangle "Problems\n(systemic blockers)" as L1
rectangle "Use-Cases\n(observable outcomes)" as L2
rectangle "Capabilities (APDP)\n(required organizational abilities)" as L3
rectangle "Mechanisms\n(structural reinforcements)\nReview Environments, CDCT, KPI Tree, ... " as L4
rectangle "Implementations\n(replaceable technical solutions)\noperators, pipelines, tools" as L5

L1 -down-> L2 : "clarify impact\n& context"
L2 -down-> L3 : "derive required\ncapabilities"
L3 -down-> L4 : "select enabling\nmechanisms"
L4 -down-> L5 : "realize via\nimplementation"

note right of L3
APDP is not a feature set.
It is a capability layer:
what an organization must be able to do
to steer decisions via feedback.
end note

note left of L1
No solutions here.
Problems remain stable and reusable
across industries and toolchains.
end note

note right of L5
Implementations change.
Capabilities should remain stable.
end note
