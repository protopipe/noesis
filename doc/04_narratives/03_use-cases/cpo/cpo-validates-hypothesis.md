# CPO: Validates a Hypothesis Instead of Defending a Roadmap

## Problems Addressed

- Solution Fixation
- Strategy as Intent, Not as Hypothesis
- Decisions Without Feedback
- Opaque Decision Logic

## Situation

Product discussions often revolve around opinions and urgency signals.
Decisions get made, but the rationale and conditions for revisiting them remain implicit.
Once a roadmap is declared, defending it becomes the default behavior.

## What Changes

Discussions shift from opinion to explicit problem framing and measurable expectations.
Decisions become hypotheses with clear signals and revisit criteria.
Alignment is achieved through evidence rather than agreement.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must be able to formulate product decisions as explicit hypotheses with measurable signals and a shared mechanism to revisit decisions when evidence contradicts assumptions.

## Result

The CPO no longer defends a roadmap as identity or commitment.
They validate learning and steer based on outcomes rather than narratives.
