# CTO: Context Map Built In

## Problems Addressed

- Big Ball of Mud
- Conway’s Law Unmanaged
- High Coupling, Low Fault Locality
- Untestable Architecture

## Situation

Architectural risk hides in coupling, unclear boundaries, and tribal knowledge.
Ownership is hard to reason about, dependencies are opaque, and architectural discussions lack a shared, current map.
As a result, autonomy decreases as coordination and integration complexity increase.

## What Changes

Boundaries and dependencies become explicit and continuously visible.
Ownership and coupling are traceable, making architectural risk discussable and actionable.
The CTO can steer architecture with a shared mental model rather than relying on institutional memory.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must maintain explicit boundaries and dependency visibility that align organizational ownership with system structure.

## Result

Architectural risk becomes manageable because coupling and boundaries are visible.
Coordination costs drop as teams can reason about dependencies and ownership without recurring alignment overhead.
