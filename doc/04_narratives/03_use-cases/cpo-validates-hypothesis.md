# A CPO Validates a Hypothesis

Before Protopipe, roadmap discussions revolve around opinions:
- “This feature feels important.”
- “Customers asked for it.”
- “Competitors already have it.”

With Protopipe, the discussion shifts:

- What problem are we solving?
- What do we expect to change?
- How will we measure it?

The CPO does not defend a roadmap.
They validate a hypothesis.

The outcome is not agreement.
The outcome is **clarity**.
