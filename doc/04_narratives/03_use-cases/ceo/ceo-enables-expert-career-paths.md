# CEO: Enables Expert Career Paths Without Hierarchical Drift

## Problems Addressed

- The Peter Principle
- Political Trust Over Competence
- Opaque Decision Logic
- Responsibility Without Control

## Situation

Career progression is primarily tied to hierarchy.
Experts are promoted into management roles
to gain influence, compensation, or recognition —
often at the cost of decision quality and technical depth.

Over time, authority moves away from understanding,
and politics replaces competence as the trust currency.

## What Changes

The organization establishes explicit expert career paths
with real decision influence and compensation parity.
Authority is linked to demonstrated problem-solving capability,
not to position or visibility.

Leadership and expertise are separated,
but equally valued.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must support multiple advancement paths
that preserve technical and decision competence
without forcing hierarchical promotion.

## Result

Decision quality remains high as the organization grows.
Experts stay close to problems,
and leadership focuses on enabling systems
instead of compensating for lost understanding.
