# CEO: Scales Responsibility Through Decision Boundaries

## Problems Addressed

- Responsibility Without Control
- Pseudo Team Autonomy
- Opaque Decision Logic
- Coordination Over Clarity

## Situation

Teams are held accountable for outcomes
they cannot materially influence.
Decision rights remain implicit or centralized,
so delivery depends on escalation and approval loops.

Responsibility is distributed.
Control is not.

## What Changes

Decision boundaries become explicit and tied to system boundaries.
Responsibility and authority move together:
teams can act within clear decision rights
and are measured on outcomes they control.

Escalation stops being the default coordination mechanism.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must be able to define and enforce decision rights at system boundaries,
and revise those boundaries based on evidence and changing context.

## Result

Responsibility scales without increasing management bottlenecks.
Teams become truly autonomous because they control the levers they are accountable for.
