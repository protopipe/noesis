# CPO: Time to Market Through Learning

Time to market is not delivery speed.
It is the time between idea and validated impact.

Protopipe shortens this cycle by design:
- hypotheses replace feature commitments
- feedback loops start immediately
- learning is continuous

The CPO optimizes learning velocity,
not roadmap pressure.
