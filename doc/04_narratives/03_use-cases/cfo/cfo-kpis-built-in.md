# CFO: KPIs Built In and Decision-Relevant

## Problems Addressed

- Metrics Without Causality
- Unmeasured Opportunity Costs
- Reporting Over Reasoning
- Feature Output over Outcome

## Situation

Financial steering relies on reported numbers that are often decoupled from decisions and delivery realities.
Opportunity costs remain largely invisible, while discussions center on output and utilization rather than measurable impact.
This makes prioritization and investment decisions slower and riskier.

## What Changes

KPIs become decision-linked signals rather than retrospective reporting artifacts.
The CFO can connect strategic bets to measurable outcomes and detect opportunity cost earlier because learning velocity and constraints become visible.

## Enabled Capability

The organization must maintain an explicit causal linkage from decisions and hypotheses to metrics, including the ability to review and revise assumptions based on observed outcomes.

## Result

The CFO gains decision-grade visibility into impact, constraints, and opportunity cost.
Investment and prioritization shifts from reporting cycles to evidence-driven steering.
