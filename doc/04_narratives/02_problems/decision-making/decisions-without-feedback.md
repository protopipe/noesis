# Decisions Without Feedback

## The Problem

Most organizations do not lack expertise.
They lack feedback.

Decisions are made based on confidence, consensus, or hierarchy.
Their real impact becomes visible weeks or months later.

By the time reality responds,
learning is expensive and responsibility is already diffuse.

---

## Why This Happens

- Feedback loops are slow or indirect
- Measurement is decoupled from decision-making
- Consequences are distributed across teams and time
- Authority substitutes evidence
- Learning is postponed until after delivery

Decisions are treated as commitments,
not as hypotheses that can be tested and revised.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Strategic decisions are debated, not validated
- Explanations follow outcomes instead of shaping them
- Failures trigger post-mortems instead of course corrections
- Responsibility is unclear once impact becomes visible
- The same mistakes reappear in different forms

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When feedback arrives late:

- incorrect decisions are scaled quickly
- course correction becomes costly
- teams optimize execution instead of understanding
- delivery speed increases without improving outcomes

Learning lags behind delivery.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

No single team can fix missing feedback.

The problem is rooted in:
- organizational structures
- planning and reporting mechanisms
- incentive systems
- separation of decision-making and measurement

Without structural feedback loops,
decisions remain opinions until reality intervenes.
