# Metrics Without Causality

## The Problem

Many organizations collect and report metrics
without understanding the causal relationships behind them.

Numbers are visible,
but the levers that influence them are not.

Metrics describe what happened,
but not why it happened
or what decision should change as a result.

---

## Why This Happens

- Metrics are selected because they are easy to measure
- KPIs are inherited from frameworks or industry standards
- Reporting focuses on outcomes, not drivers
- Cause-and-effect relationships are implicit or assumed
- Metrics are detached from concrete decisions

Measurement becomes descriptive,
not actionable.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Large dashboards with little decision relevance
- Metrics improve without corresponding business impact
- Teams optimize local numbers with unclear global effects
- Discussions focus on explaining numbers, not changing behavior
- Different metrics point in conflicting directions

Visibility increases,
but understanding does not.

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When metrics lack causality:

- teams cannot predict the impact of changes
- learning cycles depend on trial and error
- decisions are delayed due to uncertainty
- optimization focuses on symptoms, not causes

Speed decreases
because steering remains guesswork.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

Causal metrics cannot be created locally.

They require:
- shared models of cause and effect
- alignment between strategy, product, and execution
- structural linkage between decisions and measurement

Without explicit causality,
metrics become retrospective artifacts
instead of steering instruments.
