# Feature Output over Outcome

## The Problem

Many organizations measure progress by the number of features delivered,
not by the outcomes those features produce.

Delivery becomes the goal.
Impact becomes optional.

As long as features ship on time,
their actual effect on users or business metrics remains secondary.

---

## Why This Happens

- Output metrics are easier to track than outcomes
- Roadmaps reward completion, not learning
- Success is associated with delivery, not impact
- Outcomes are delayed, ambiguous, or hard to attribute
- Measurement is separated from product development

Features become proxies for progress.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Roadmaps fill up, but results remain unclear
- Success is defined by completion, not change
- Teams deliver continuously but struggle to explain impact
- Learnings are anecdotal and retrospective
- Features accumulate without clear justification

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When output replaces outcome:

- teams optimize for throughput instead of effectiveness
- incorrect assumptions scale quickly
- learning is delayed until after significant investment
- delivery speed increases without improving results

The organization moves faster,
but not necessarily in the right direction.

---

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

No individual team can shift focus from output to outcome alone.

The problem is reinforced by:
- planning and budgeting cycles
- performance metrics
- incentive systems
- portfolio governance models

As long as delivery is rewarded independently of impact,
organizations will continue to ship features
without knowing whether they matter.
