# Yak Shaving Over the Critical Path

## The Problem

Organizations often invest significant effort into solving problems
that are not on the critical path.

This behavior is frequently justified as being “agile”:
teams start with a small, manageable problem,
expecting to extend the solution incrementally over time.

In practice, this means that work begins
where uncertainty and risk are lowest —
not where learning would be most valuable.

---

## Why This Happens

- “Start small” is interpreted as “start safe”
- Agility is confused with incremental scope expansion
- Teams want to demonstrate progress early
- Peripheral problems feel concrete and solvable
- Critical-path uncertainties feel abstract and risky

Instead of validating the hardest assumptions first,
organizations optimize for visible activity.

Yak shaving becomes a way to feel agile
while avoiding the core uncertainty.

## Observable Symptoms

- Work starts on auxiliary or enabling components
- Shared infrastructure is built “to get started”
- Central systems are implemented before assumptions are tested
- The critical decision is postponed repeatedly
- Early solutions require major rework or compensation later

Progress appears continuous,
but learning about the real risk is delayed.

---

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When work does not start on the critical path:

- learning about feasibility and impact is postponed
- incorrect assumptions are embedded early
- later changes affect highly coupled components
- rework becomes expensive and politically difficult

Delivery speed increases initially,
but collapses once the critical path is finally addressed.

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

This behavior is not caused by lack of discipline.

It is reinforced by:
- common interpretations of agile practices
- incentive systems rewarding early output
- centralized ownership of shared components
- planning processes that favor incremental expansion
  over early risk validation

When solutions are built away from the critical path —
especially in central or shared systems —
mistakes accumulate as technical debt,
delays, and complex compensations
exactly where change is hardest.
