# Identity

Identity defines how Protopipe **recognizes and expresses itself** —
visually, verbally, and structurally.

This chapter establishes **canonical identity constraints**.
Anything derived from Protopipe (slides, website, demos, prototypes, UI surfaces)
must reference and align with this identity.

Identity is normative for expression,
but not for decision-making.

## Scope of Identity

Identity covers:

- Corporate Identity / Corporate Design (CI/CD)
- Visual grammar and recurring motifs
- Verbal tone and naming consistency
- UI principles for prototypes and product surfaces
- Recognition patterns across media

Identity ensures that Protopipe is:
- recognizable
- coherent
- intentional
- distinguishable from similar approaches

---

## Design Language (Canonical)

The design language defined here is **canonical**.

This includes in particular:

- the **Swimlane concept** as a primary visual grammar
- structural layouts that emphasize responsibility and flow
- visual constraints that make dependencies and boundaries visible
- reduction of decorative elements in favor of structure

Design decisions outside these constraints
must be explicitly justified and documented.

---

## Derivatives and Responsibility

All derivative artifacts:
- slides
- websites
- mockups
- demos
- prototypes
- diagrams

are **non-canonical** by default.

They are expected to:
- reference this chapter
- remain consistent with its constraints
- evolve independently without redefining identity

Changes to identity itself are rare,
intentional,
and subject to review.

## Identity vs. Culture vs. Mechanics

To avoid ambiguity:

- **Culture** defines values and attitudes  
  (how people are expected to think and behave)

- **Mechanics** define enforced consequences  
  (what becomes unavoidable or impossible)

- **Identity** defines expression and recognition  
  (how Protopipe appears and is perceived)

Identity does not:
- enforce behavior
- define trade-offs
- justify decisions

It provides a stable frame of reference
for consistent expression.

---

## Final Note

Identity is not branding decoration.

It is a structural asset:
- it reduces cognitive load
- it increases recognition
- it prevents accidental divergence

Treat it with the same care
as any other canonical part of Noesis.
