# Opaque Decision Logic

## The Problem

In many organizations, it is unclear how decisions are made,
why they were made,
and under which conditions they should be revisited.

Even when decisions are documented,
the underlying reasoning, assumptions, and influences
remain implicit or scattered.

As a result, decisions lose their stabilizing function.

## Why This Happens

- Decisions are recorded without their context
- Rationale is replaced by outcomes or action items
- External influences and constraints are not made explicit
- Decision reviews are informal or nonexistent
- Revisiting decisions is seen as either failure or disloyalty

Decision-making focuses on *what* was decided,
not on *why* or *until when*.

---

## Observable Symptoms

- Teams repeatedly revisit the same decisions
- Solutions oscillate without clear resolution
- Long discussions reopen previously “decided” topics
- Decisions are defended even when they block progress
- People rely on authority or memory instead of evidence

Two extremes dominate:
- decisions are constantly overturned, or
- decisions become untouchable.

## Why This Blocks Fast Delivery and Learning

When decision logic is opaque:

- teams lack criteria for course correction
- learning does not translate into changed decisions
- progress stalls due to repeated re-evaluation
- or organizations persist with decisions long past their usefulness

Delivery becomes either unstable
or rigid —
both slow learning and execution.

## Why This Is a Systemic Problem

Clear decision logic cannot be enforced locally.

It depends on:
- shared expectations about decision review
- explicit assumptions and constraints
- cultural acceptance of revisiting decisions
- structural feedback loops between outcome and intent

Without transparent decision logic,
organizations alternate between volatility and paralysis —
and lose the ability to steer deliberately.
