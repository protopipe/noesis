# Role Template (Canonical)

This document defines the **mandatory structure** for all role descriptions
used in Protopipe AI contexts.

Roles are not personas.
They are **decision environments**.

The purpose of a role definition is to:
- stabilize AI output
- prevent tone drift
- encode emotional and cognitive expectations explicitly
- anchor abstract reasoning in lived reality

---

## 1. Cognitive Frame (Non-Negotiable)

Describe how this role **perceives and reasons about reality**.

This section defines:
- dominant mental models
- what counts as signal
- what is considered noise
- which abstractions and comparisons are acceptable

Use **explicit reference domains**
(e.g. industries, disciplines, systems the role is familiar with).

Rules:
- Do not explain the reference domains.
- Do not justify them.
- Assume familiarity and competence.

This section defines **how reality is interpreted**.

---

## 2. Emotional Baseline (Mandatory)

Define how it should **feel** to be addressed in this role.

This is not about empathy or friendliness.
It is about **emotional calibration**.

Specify explicitly:
- the emotional state that should be triggered
- the tone that is expected
- what must be avoided

Emotion is a **control parameter**, not decoration.

---

## 3. Lived Reality Anchors (Mandatory)

Describe concrete, recurring situations
this role experiences in everyday work.

These are **recognition triggers**.

Purpose:
- create immediate resonance
- signal deep domain familiarity
- ground abstract concepts in reality

Characteristics:
- concrete
- unglamorous
- slightly uncomfortable
- immediately recognizable

Rules:
- Do not dramatize.
- Do not exaggerate.
- Do not explain why this matters.

The role should think:
> “Yes. That’s exactly how this shows up in my day.”

---

## 4. Who You Are Addressing

Describe the role in terms of:
- responsibility
- accountability
- constraints
- decision pressure

Focus on:
- what cannot be delegated
- what failure looks like
- how success is measured

No biography.
No demographics.

---

## 5. Decision Translation Rules

Define how **all content must be translated** for this role.

Specify:
- which dimensions matter for decisions
- how abstract concepts must be reframed
- what makes information relevant or irrelevant

If something cannot be translated into these dimensions,
it should not appear in the output.

---

## 6. Innovation / Technology Frame (Optional)

If technology or AI is relevant for this role, define explicitly:
- what technology represents
- what it amplifies
- what it is not

Avoid hype.
Anchor technology in structure and constraints.

---

## 7. Expected Output Shape

Define how responses should be structured.

Specify:
- ordering (e.g. executive summary first)
- preferred formats
- level of explicitness around assumptions and uncertainty

This section controls **form**, not content.

---

## Global Rules (Apply to All Roles)

- Do not persuade.
- Do not evangelize.
- Do not moralize.
- Do not optimize for likability.

Operate at eye level.
Demonstrate clarity.
Make trade-offs visible.

Roles exist to reduce ambiguity,
not to create comfort.
